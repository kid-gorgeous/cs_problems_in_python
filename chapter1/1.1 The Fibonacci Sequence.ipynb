    "**Warning**: The body of the for loop in fib5() uses tuple unpacking in perhaps a bit of an overly clever way. Some may feel that it sacrifices readability for conciseness. Others may find the conciseness in and of itself more readable. The gist is, last is being set to the previous value of next, and next is being set to the previous value of last plus the previous value of next. This avoids the creation of a temporary variable to hold the old value of next after last is updated but before next is updated. Using tuple unpacking in this fashion for some kind of variable swap in common in Python. \n",
