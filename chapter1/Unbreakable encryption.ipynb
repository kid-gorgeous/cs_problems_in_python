    "A one-time pad is way of encryption a piece of data by combining it with meaningless random dummy data in such a way that the original cannot be reconstituted without access to both the product and the dummy data. In essence, this leaves the encryter with a key pair. One key is the product, and the other is the random dummy data. One key on its own is useless; only the combination of both keys can unlock the origical data. When performed correctly, a one-time pad is a form of unbreakable encrytion. \n",

    "In this example, we will encrypt a str using a one-time pad. One way thinking about a Python 3 str is as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes (with UTF-8 using a Unicode character encoding). A str is as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes (represented as the bytes type) throught the encode() method. Likewise, a sequence of UTF-8 bytes can be converted back into a str using the decode() method on the bytes type.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three criteria that the dummy data used in a one-time pad encryption operation must meet for the resulting product to be unbreakable. The dummy data must be the same length as the original data, truly random, and completely secret. The first and third criteria are common sense. If the dummy data repeats because it it too short, there could be an observed pattern. If one of the keys is not truly secret (perhaps it is reused elsewhere or partially revealed), then an attacker has a clue. The second criteria poses a question all its own; how to produce truly random data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will use the pseudo-random data generating function token_bytes() from the secrets module (first included in the standard library in Python) Our data will not be truly random, in the sense that the secrets package still is using a pseudo-random number generator behind the scenes, but it will be close enough for our purposes. Let's generate a random key for use as dummy data.\n"

    "This function creates an int filled with length random bytes. The method int.from_bytes() is used to convert from bytes to int. How can multiple bytes be converted to a single integer? The answer lies in section 1.2. In that section, you learned that the int type can be of arbitrary size, and you saw how it can be used as a generic bit string. int is being used in the same way here. For example, the from_bytes() method will take 7 bytes (7bytes * 8bits = 56bits) and convert them into a 56-bit integer. Bitwise operations can be executed more easily and performantly on a single int (read \"long bit string\") than on many individual bytes in a sequence, this sequence uses the Bitwise operation XOR. \n",

    "**NOTE** int.from_bytes() is being passed two arguements. The first is the bytes that we want to convert into an int. The second is the *endianness* of those bytes (\"big\"). Endianness refers to the byte-ordering used to store data. Does the most significant byte come first, or does the least significant byte come first? In this case, it does not matter as long as we use the same ordering both when we encrypt and decrypt, because we are actually only manipulating the data at the individual bit leve. In other situations, when you are not controlling both ends of the encoding process, the ordering can absolutely matter.\n",

To get this number, we divide the bit length by eight (the number of bits in a byte). Finally, the bytes method decode() gives us back a str."
